# Simple resource group example

## Overview

Using this template you can start two instances which are organised as `OS::Heat::ResourceGroups`.

## Usage

```$ openstack stack create -t group.yaml <stackName>```

This will start two instances without access from public network. They are only meant as an example how you can organise a number of resources.

## Code organisation

The file group.yaml references the resources in server.yaml via the resource group. The property count controls the number of times the resources in server.yaml will be instantiated.

## Parameters

This example does not make use of parameters.
